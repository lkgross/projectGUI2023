# projectGUI2023
This is a repo to introduce grpahical user interfaces (GUIs) in JavaFX.
Note build.gradle has some new content, so that we can use JavaFX.
Clone the repo.
To run this project that uses JavaFX, open the Gradle pane on the right edge of the IntelliJ window. Go to Tasks -> Application -> Run. Double click run.
(Do NOT do Build/Execution/Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Run this project in IntelliJ. Now we have a new protocol.)
